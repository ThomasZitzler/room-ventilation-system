 * @brief Watchdog which resets the system on deadlock.
 *
 * When the system deadlocks and doesn't respond for some time, the watchdog
 * timer fires. It calls a custom routine, which can for instance store crash
 * data into EEPROM, so it's available at the restart.
 *
 * The implementation is inspired by https://github.com/Megunolink/ArduinoCrashMonitor.
